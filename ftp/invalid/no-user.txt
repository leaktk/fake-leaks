On some systems, particularly on GNU/Linux, these libraries may
already be present or available as additional packages.  Note that if
there is a separate `dev' or `devel' package, for use at compilation
time rather than run time, you will need that as well as the
corresponding run time package; typically the dev package will
contain header files and a library archive.  Otherwise, you can
download and build libraries from sources.  None of them are vital for
running Emacs; however, note that Emacs will not be able to use
colored icons in the toolbar if XPM support is not compiled in.

Here's the list of these optional libraries, and the URLs where they
can be found:
